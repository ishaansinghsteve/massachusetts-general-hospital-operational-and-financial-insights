Massachusetts General Hospital — Operational & Financial Insights

Prepared By: Ishaan Singh

Project Overview:

Analyzed operational and financial data of Massachusetts General Hospital (2011–2022) using MySQL and Tableau Public. The project demonstrates data cleaning, denormalization, and dashboard-based analysis by transforming multiple raw healthcare datasets into a single analytical file.

Project Components:

1. Raw CSV Files: Patients, encounters, procedures, payers, and organizations data used as the base datasets.

2. Denormalized CSV Dataset: Single master CSV file created using MySQL by cleaning and joining the five raw CSV files.

3. MySQL Scripts: Scripts used for data cleaning, data type conversion, relationship definition, and denormalization.

4. ERD Diagram: Entity Relationship Diagram created using MySQL to define and validate relationships between the datasets.

5. Tableau Dashboards: Two interactive dashboards created in Tableau Public covering operational and financial insights.

6. Screenshots Folder: Screenshots of both Tableau dashboards and the ERD diagram.

7. Data Dictionaries: Column-level documentation for each raw CSV file and the final denormalized CSV.

8. Project Summary & Key Insights: Case summary and consolidated operational and financial insights derived from the dashboards.

Tools Used:

MySQL | Tableau Public | Data Cleaning | Data Analysis | Data Visualization / Dashboarding
